# Electrical Engineering 234 Workspace
### Zach Nett, 2020
----
This is a private repository meant for keeping track of the projects for EE234, or Microprocessor Systems.

If I ever were to release this repository, I would most likely alter or remove some code such that it could not be used dishonestly by anyone taking the class in the future (though some of this code is a bit esoteric and undocumented regardless).
